The graphs help you understand how to set the optimal threshold to balance between false positives and false negatives.

    ### Interpretation:
    - **Precision** (blue line): Percentage of correct positive predictions. Higher values mean fewer false positives.
    - **Recall** (green line): Percentage of actual positives correctly identified. Higher values mean fewer false negatives.
    - **F1 Score** (red line): Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Higher values indicate better overall performance.
    - **Vertical line**: The optimal threshold that maximizes the F1 score.
    
    As you increase the threshold:
    - Precision increases (fewer false matches)
    - Recall decreases (more false non-matches)

    ### Interpretation:
    - **Green histogram**: Distribution of similarity scores for matching pairs (same person)
    - **Red histogram**: Distribution of similarity scores for non-matching pairs (different people)
    - **Vertical line**: The optimal threshold that separates the two distributions
    
    Ideally:
    - The green distribution should be mostly to the right of the threshold
    - The red distribution should be mostly to the left of the threshold
    - Minimal overlap between the two distributions
    
    If you're experiencing false matches:
    - Look at where the red distribution extends beyond the threshold
    - Consider increasing the threshold to reduce false positives

# Threshold adjustment recommendations
st.header("Threshold Adjustment Recommendations")
st.markdown("""
### How to adjust the threshold:

1. **If you're getting false matches** (different people identified as the same):
   - Increase the threshold (try 0.35-0.45)
   - This makes the matching more strict
   - Reduces false positives but may increase false negatives

2. **If you're getting false non-matches** (same person not recognized):
   - Decrease the threshold (try 0.15-0.25)
   - This makes the matching more lenient
   - Reduces false negatives but may increase false positives

3. **For a balanced approach**:
   - Use a threshold around 0.25-0.35
   - This attempts to balance false positives and false negatives

Remember that no threshold will be perfect - there's always a trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
